# Halloween Gags

Various Halloween-related projects that I've built to scare or amuse
trick-or-treaters.

### Air Spray Controller

An arudino project that controls an air value.  When an IR beam is
interrupted (because someone walked in front of the transmitter) the
adruino will open the air value for a fraction of a second.  The air
value is connected to an air compressor and makes a relatively loud
sound when opened, as well as suddenly spraying an unsuspecting victim
with a burst of air.

The controller circuit also sends out a signal that triggers a camera
(which takes a picture of the victim) and turns on a fog machine for a
few seconds.  These circuits are not included in this repository.

Pictures taken by the camera module:

### Random Blinking Eyes

Pairs of red LEDs that "blink" at random intervals.  Every 60 seconds,
all of the eyes turn on at the same time with full intensity.  These
look really nice placed in the various plants in the front of my
house.
